# Welcome to Pairing:

Check out our latest meetup RSVP information here: http://www.meetup.com/la-fullstack/

## Things to do before your first Pairing Meetup:
1. **Code editor**: Install a code editor. If you do not have one already, here's our favorite for Macs: https://atom.io/
2. **GitHub**: Install the GitHub app if you do not have it already, and make a GitHub account.
3. **Code of Conduct**: Read our [Code of Conduct](https://www.girldevelopit.com/code-of-conduct)
6. **All the details**: RSVP on Meetup.com to get the latest updates on the meetup location (parking, Metro access) and all those logistical details.

## When you are stuck on something:
1. When you are stuck on code: Make an issue on what you're stuck on here - https://github.com/fullstackla/pairing-meetup/issues
2. Wen you are lost, on your way, confused about Metro-access, parking, leave a comment on the http://www.meetup.com/la-fullstack/ event invite or that night. We will come find you.
3. When you have questions/concerns about code of conduct, things like that, talk to Kit or Machiko by messaging them on Meetup.com.
