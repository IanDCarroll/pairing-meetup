# Welcome to Pairing:

Check out our latest meetup RSVP information here: http://www.meetup.com/la-fullstack/

## Things to do before your first Pairing Meetup:
1. Install a code editor. Here's our favorite for Macs: https://atom.io/
2. If you want to code on your machine, try to install Exercism (for [contributing](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io), or for [programming practice](http://exercism.io)) and other necessary dependencies (like jasmine-node for JavaScript) on your own. Check our [Wiki](https://github.com/fullstackla/pairing-meetup/wiki) and Exercism's FAQ and Contributing guide for instructions.
3. If you want to code on your machine but weren't able to install, let the organizers know so we can help you at the Meetup.
4. For those more experienced coders: bring design patterns, problems, projects you want to pair on.
5. Read our [Code of Conduct](https://www.girldevelopit.com/code-of-conduct)

## Things to do between the Meetups
1. When you're stuck: Submit as much as you've got on the Solution and @mention other team members in the comments of the problem you're having trouble with.
2. When you're bored: Submit feedback on other people's submissions
