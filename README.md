# Welcome to Pairing:

Check out our latest meetup RSVP information here: http://www.meetup.com/la-fullstack/

## Things to do before your first Pairing Meetup:
- Install a code editor.
- If you want to code on your machine, try to install Exercism and other necessary dependencies (like jasmine-node for JavaScript) on your own. Check our [Wiki](https://github.com/fullstackla/pairing-meetup/wiki) and Exercism's FAQ for instructions.
- If you want to code on your machine but weren't able to install, let the organizers know so we can help you at the Meetup.
- For those more experienced coders: bring design patterns, problems, projects you want to pair on.
- Read our [Code of Conduct](https://www.girldevelopit.com/code-of-conduct)

## Things to do between the Meetups
- When you're stuck: Submit as much as you've got on the Solution and @mention other team members in the comments of the problem you're having trouble with.
- When you're bored: Submit feedback on other people's submissions
