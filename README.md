## :raised_hands: What is pair programming?

Pair Programming is the act of programming in pairs - one person is the navigator, who talks out loud about the coding direction to take and the task at hand, while the other person is the driver, who types and works on a computer. Pairing allows people to discuss the code out loud, read error messages together, break down the problem at hand together verbally and test things out together. 

Pairing also allows people to share and learn different coding tricks (like keyboard shortcuts or note-taking tools), and also mental tips (like taking a deep breath before running `rm -rf`). Pairing also allows people to share the projects they are working on, the blockers they have come across, try out a new language, or try teaching someone else a new-to-them language. 

Here are some [tips](https://github.com/fullstackla/pairing-meetup/blob/master/tips-on-pairing.md), written by fellow meetup attendees.

## Help!
1. When you are stuck on code: Make an issue on what youâ€˜re stuck on here - https://github.com/fullstackla/pairing-meetup/issues
2. When you are lost, on your way and stuck in traffic and need to let someone know about something, left something at the venue, confused about Metro-access, parking, leave a comment on the http://www.meetup.com/la-fullstack/ event invite or that night.
3. When you have questions/concerns about code of conduct, things like that, talk to Kit or Machiko by messaging them on Meetup.com.
