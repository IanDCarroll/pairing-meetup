### Pairing

Our group is comprised of a pretty good mix of backgrounds and experience levels but it does skew a bit towards those with less experience. Here are some points to consider in order to assure we are promoting a good learning environment:

- Please be mindful of your pair's experience level and avoid making assumptions on what they may/may not already know.
- Try allowing the less-experienced pair to set the pace of the session.
- Allow your pair to make mistakes and struggle; after all, getting one's hands dirty is the only way to really learn.
- Ask your pair often if they have any questions.
- Give hints, not answers.
- When teaching your pair concepts they are not familiar with, try to use as much plain English as possible and introduce the fewest number of new concepts/technical terms at a time.
- Consider body language cues. Your pair may be too afraid to tell you they didn't understand because they did not want to appear unintelligent. Patiently remind them that we are all here to learn, and teach the concept again in different ways.
- When introducing your pair to a concept that is new to them, please refrain from glossing over the difficulty of learning that concept by saying it's "easy." We know you mean well and are trying to make them feel more at ease, but imagine how demoralizing/discouraging it would be to a newbie if they don't understand the material right after you've told them it was going to be a piece of cake!
