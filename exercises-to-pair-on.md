# Criteria
- Prefer command line, code editor exercises
- Prefer testing, running programs in Terminal
- Prefer code that can be later pushed up to Git, so other people can comment on them

# For beginners
- [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io): JavaScripting, Git-It, Functional JavaScript
- Learn Command Line the Hard Way, Learn Ruby the Hard Way, Learn Python the Hard Way
- For HTML/CSS Leaners: Give them an HTML/CSS feature to implement, ask them to pair on it. One can do HTML, One can do CSS. Or, the more experienced mentor can navigate the whole time. Make sure to teach how to debug with Inspect Element and how to push up to GitHub pages.

# Pairing/Learning goals for beginners
- Learn how the command line, code editor interact.
- Learn how to run programs written in code editor in Terminal.
- Learn how to push code to Git and GitHub.
- (For HTML/CSS learners), learn how to open browser and use Inspect Element
- (For Exercism.io learners), read the test code, your code, and see how to run tests.
- Learn how to look up documentation and try out new code.
- Learn how to run the program without running the test.
- Learn how to use the REPL (Ruby, Javascript)
- *By the end of the night*: Would be great to push code up to GitHub and see it there.

# For those beyond beginners
-  `JavaScript` [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io): Scope Chains & Closures, Promises, Async, Test Anything, Towel of babel, Generators, Sass, ESNext
- [http://exercism.io/](Exercism.io): Ruby, JavaScript, Python, Java, CoffeeScript...
- Ruby Koans
- JavaScript Koans, React Koans

# Pairing/Learning goals for those beyond
- Teach someone else how the command line, code editor interacts.
- Teach someone the value of refactoring with tests.
- Try out a new language, new method, new refactoring style.
- Tackle a more challenging exercise with a pair.
- Try out a new code editor or new keyboard shortcuts.
